## My Process

To create Tenzies, I followed these steps:

1. **Design**: I started by conceptualizing the game's rules and user interface. I sketched wireframes and designed a minimalistic layout to keep the focus on the dice and game mechanics.
2. **Development**: I implemented the game using React components to manage dice state and interactions. The game logic checks for winning conditions and handles dice rolling and holding.
3. **Styling**: I utilized custom CSS to style the game elements, including the dice, buttons, and timer.

### What Problem Did I Set Out to Fix?

The goal of this project was to create an engaging and interactive dice-rolling game that allows players to test their luck and decision-making skills. I wanted to offer a simple yet enjoyable gaming experience that anyone can enjoy.

### What Were Some of the Design Decisions?

During development, I made the following design decisions:

- **Minimalistic Design**: The game's interface is kept simple, focusing on the dice and the core mechanics to ensure a straightforward and intuitive experience.
- **Responsive Layout**: The game is designed to be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes, making it accessible to players on various devices.

### What I Learned

While creating Tenzies, I learned and improved in the following areas:

- **React State Management**: I deepened my understanding of managing state in React components and using `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to create dynamic behavior.
- **Game Logic**: I gained experience in implementing game logic, such as checking for winning conditions and handling user interactions in real-time.

### What I Would Change If I Had More Time

Given more time, I would enhance Tenzies by adding the following features:

- **Scoreboard**: Implement a scoreboard to keep track of players' best times and number of rolls to achieve "Tenzies."
- **Difficulty Levels**: Introduce difficulty levels with varying dice quantities or changing rolling patterns.
- **Sound Effects**: Include sound effects to enhance the gaming experience.
